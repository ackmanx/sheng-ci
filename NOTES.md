* Find a replacement for webtask.io because it's unreliable
    * Random error when logging in is the norm
    * Replacement must have free json storage that doesn't auto-delete (not a cache)
    * Replacement must allow Express and middleware

* BUG
    * You have to click once to "clear" or something selected menu, before another menu can be opened
    * This happens both when a menu is already open and after deleting so the entry is gone
